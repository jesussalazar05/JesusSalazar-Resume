        <p class="lead mb-4">I am Jesus Salazar and I am a third year Education major 
        at the university of California, Riverside. I am studying to become a middle 
        school math teacher. I went to a high school within a low-income community,
        which has shaped my thought process and the up bringing for now. 
Music has been a huge part of my life, especially in the performing arts. 
This can be from concert band to marching band. My favorite thing to do was perform with the marching percussion group because I have a passion with drumming. This activity has shaped how I carry myself with everything I do. I was apart of marching tenors for more than 8 years now. I was able to travel to places I wouldnâ€™t have had been able to go to without music. Some being Las Vegas, Hawaii, and to travel across the states. I felt determined to practice every single day, which as a result I was able to make RCC Fall Marching Band; a group that Iâ€™ve dreamed of making. 
. <br><br>

        I currently work as an AVID tutor for Gage Middle School. This position has opened the doors in my education journey in becoming an educator. Iâ€™ve been working there since graduating high school and it has allowed to me to be on the path that I chose. I initially was leaning towards becoming an engineer but being able to help students makes me more passionate. I love to teach students, give them tools to succeed on their path onto college. This program has given me the opportunity to attend a 4-year university and further my academic journey past high school. I am a first-generation student in my family and the first to experience this all. I can now pass this key information onto the younger generation, that I didnâ€™t have at their age. 
The STEM subjects have always been my strongest subjects. I want to become a middle school math teacher because I love Math more than any other subject. I am currently finishing up my third year, and plan on preparing myself for CSETs for single subject. I plan on applying to the UCR Teacher Education Program after graduating June 2021. I also plan on taking my CBSET so I can work as a substitute teacher after I graduate. This will help me understand the classroom setting much more.
<br><br>

        There is a slight possibility that I will minor Spanish because I want to be able to teach a classroom as dual immersion. I want to work in a district that doesnâ€™t have the resources compared to the richer communities because there are brilliant minds in every school. It just needs the right guidance to allow them to grow up into someone that will impact the world. Spanish is my native language and there is an increase of people speaking it. I will also plan on giving back and teach a high school music drum line program on any free time I have. I do not want to step out of it.
